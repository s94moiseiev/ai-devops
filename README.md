| app.yaml | "create an app gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0 deployment with 1 replicas and port 8080" | "Create a deployment for the app with the image gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0. The deployment should consist of 1 replica and expose port 8080 for communication." | [app.yaml](./yaml/app.yaml) |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml | "create an app gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0 deployment with 1 replicas and port 8080 add only liveness probe" | "Create a deployment for the app with the image gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0, configuring it with 1 replica and exposing port 8080. Additionally, include a liveness probe for health checking purposes." | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](./yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | "create an app gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0 deployment with 1 replicas and port 8080 add only readiness probe" | "Set up a deployment for the application using the image gcr.io/erudite-bloom-416620/demo:v1.0.0. Specify 1 replica and expose port 8080. Include a readiness probe to ensure the application is ready to accept traffic." | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](./yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml | "create an app-volume gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1 with 1 replicas, volume data with host path /var/lib/app mount path /app  and port 8080, add liveness /healthy readiness /ready" | Develop an application with a volume named 'data' utilizing the image gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1. The deployment should consist of 1 replica, exposing port 8080. Attach a host path /var/lib/app to the volume, mounting it at /app. Additionally, implement liveness and readiness probes for health and readiness checks respectively. | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](./yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| app-cronjob.yaml | "create cronjob app-cronjob every 5 minut image bash wich print hello world" | "Create a cronjob named 'app-cronjob' scheduled to run every 5 minutes.

| app-job.yaml | "create Job named 'app-job-rsync' use image 'google/cloud-sdk:275.0.0-alpine'. This task synchronizes data from the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket 'gs://glow-sportradar/' to the destination '/data/input', Volume has fs xfs name data-input use gcePersistentDisk." | Create a Job named 'app-job-rsync' utilizing the image 'google/cloud-sdk:275.0.0-alpine'. This job's objective is to synchronize data from the Google Cloud Storage bucket 'gs://glow-sportradar/' to the destination '/data/input'. To facilitate this, utilize a volume named 'data-input' with the filesystem XFS, employing a GCE Persistent Disk for storage | [app-job.yaml](./yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| app-multicontainer.yaml | "create Pod named 'app-multi-containers' is created with two containers. The first container uses the Nginx image to serve web content, mounting the 'html' volume to '/usr/share/nginx/html'. The second container uses the Debian image, also mounting the 'html' volume, but to '/html'. The second container runs a command to continuously append the current date to the file '/html/index.html'." | Set up a Pod named 'app-multi-containers' containing two containers. The first container utilizes the Nginx image to serve web content, mounting the 'html' volume to '/usr/share/nginx/html'. The second container employs the Debian image, also mounting the 'html' volume, but to '/html'. Additionally, the second container executes a command to continuously append the current date to the file '/html/index.html'. | [app-multicontainer.yaml](./yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources.yaml | " create Pod named 'app-resource' is defined with a single container. The container uses the image 'gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1' and is configured with liveness and readiness probes. The liveness probe performs an HTTP GET request to '/healthy' on port 8080 with an initial delay of 5 seconds, a timeout of 1 second, a period of 10 seconds, and a failure threshold of 3. The readiness probe performs an HTTP GET request to '/ready' on port 8080 with a period of 2 seconds, an initial delay of 0 seconds, a failure threshold of 3, and a success threshold of 1. The container exposes port 8080 for HTTP traffic. Resource requests are set to 100m CPU and 128Mi memory, while resource limits are set to 100m CPU and 256Mi memory." | Define a Pod named 'app-resource' containing a single container. This container utilizes the image 'gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1' and is equipped with both liveness and readiness probes. The liveness probe executes an HTTP GET request to '/healthy' on port 8080 after an initial delay of 5 seconds. It has a timeout of 1 second, a period of 10 seconds, and a failure threshold of 3. The readiness probe conducts an HTTP GET request to '/ready' on port 8080, with a period of 2 seconds and no initial delay. It has a failure threshold of 3 and a success threshold of 1. Furthermore, the container exposes port 8080 for HTTP traffic. Resource requests are configured at 100m CPU and 128Mi memory, while resource limits are set to 100m CPU and 256Mi memory | [app-resources.yaml](./yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| app-secret-env.yaml | "create Pod named 'app-secret-env' is defined with a single container named 'mycontainer', using the Redis image. The container is configured with two environment variables, 'SECRET_USERNAME' and 'SECRET_PASSWORD', which obtain their values from the 'mysecret1' secret, using the keys 'username' and 'password' respectively. The container does not automatically restart after termination." | "Define a Pod named 'app-secret-env' containing a single container named 'mycontainer', utilizing the Redis image. The container is customized with two environment variables, 'SECRET_USERNAME' and 'SECRET_PASSWORD', sourcing their values from the 'mysecret1' secret. Specifically, 'SECRET_USERNAME' retrieves its value from the key 'username', while 'SECRET_PASSWORD' fetches its value from the key 'password'. Additionally, the container is configured not to automatically restart upon termination." | [app-secret-env.yaml](./yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
